# Blockchain for Social Impact Decentralized Incubator
The Decentralized Impact Incubator is a 6-week program to ideate and prototype blockchain-based solutions to global social and environmental challenges. During the period, participants from around the world gather to form teams, design business models, draft proposals and code. Teams need to pass through weekly checkpoints and are guided by mentors throughout the process.

This repository holds the community created projects for blockchain. Currently this will be the main repository for the BSIC Decentralized Impact Incubator
